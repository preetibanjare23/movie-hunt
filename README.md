# Movie Hunt Website

## Description
This is a simple movie search web application that allows users to search for movies using the OMDb API and view basic information about them. 

## Features
* **Search Functionality:** Users can search for movies by title.
* **Movie Information:** Display basic movie information such as title, poster, year of release, and IMDb link.
* **API Integration:** Uses the OMDb API to fetch movie data.
* **Responsive Design:**  Adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## Technologies Used
* **HTML:** Structures the basic layout and content of the web page.
* **CSS:** Styles the appearance of the web page, making it visually appealing.
* **JavaScript:** Provides dynamic functionality, handles user interactions, fetches data from the API, and updates the web page content.
* **OMDb API:** An external API (Application Programming Interface) used to retrieve movie data.

## How it Works
1. **API Key:** You will need to replace the placeholder 'f9994295' in the `main.js` file with your actual OMDb API key.
2. **Search:** Users enter a movie title into the search bar and click the "Search" button.
3. **API Request:** JavaScript code sends a request to the OMDb API with the search term.
4. **Data Fetching:** The API responds with the movie data in JSON format.
5. **Displaying Results:** The JavaScript code parses the JSON data and dynamically creates HTML elements to display the movie information on the page, including posters, titles, release years, and links to the IMDb page.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-search-app.git`
2. **Open index.html:** Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to use the movie search application.

## Usage
1. **Enter Movie Title:** Type the title of the movie you want to search for in the search bar.
2. **Search:** Click the "Search" button to initiate the search.
3. **View Results:** The search results (up to 50 movies) will be displayed below the search bar.
4. **Explore Movies:** Click on a movie poster or title to open its IMDb page in a new tab for more information. 

## Future Enhancements

* **Filtering/Sorting:** Allow users to filter results by year, genre, etc., and sort by popularity, rating.
* **Detailed Movie View:**  Create a dedicated page to show more comprehensive details about a selected movie.
* **User Reviews/Ratings:** Integrate a system for users to leave reviews and ratings for movies.
